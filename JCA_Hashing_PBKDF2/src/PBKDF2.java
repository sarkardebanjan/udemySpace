 * This class is based on the Bouncy Castle Java class

 * 
 * It uses the SHA512 HMAC as default. Only JCE/JCA classes are being used.
 * HmacSHA512 is included in JRE 1.8++. This class also runs below 1.8.
 * Then, BC or others have to be used to include the HmacSHA512 algorithm
 * or a different HMAC has to be used.
